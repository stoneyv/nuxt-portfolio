# OCR of Cargo Container Markings

A proof of concept for recognizing shipping container markings and accelerating inspection and throughput of containers.  The particular container port has intermittent internet connectivity and needs to process and store results on site.  The company interfacing with the customer is not likely to sell this service to repeat customers, so I recommended that they purchase an existing solution instead of doing custom work that they would not be able to leverage multiple times in the next two years.

A YOLO model is needed to correlate the text blob regions with the shipping container markings
