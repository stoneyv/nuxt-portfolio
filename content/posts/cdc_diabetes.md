I began this side project in order to develop methods of disemminating self contained dashboards to stakeholders without the need to access a dashboard server such as Shiny in the R ecosystem or Plotly Dash in the python ecosystem.  Unfortunately the different community sourced components for flexdashboard result in interfaces that are not consistent and limited in functionality. I used the flexdashboard package from the R CRAN repository.

One excellent result of this side project is that I learned to transform a standard US shapefile to a geojson or topojson file with Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico repositioned.

This particular topic of diabetes and obesity diagnosis in the US is an excellent candidate for a well constructed data gif.  The evolution of the rate of obesity and diabetes in alarming.  What we eat and when we eat is responsible for so many chronic conditions.  The lack of accesibility of primary health care as well as poor advice on nutrition and an increased consumption of processed foods at frequent invervals has severly impacted our health and budgets. I highly recommend listening to the audio book or reading two books written by Dr. Jason Fung.  You might start with The Cancer Code first. What is very interesting is the evidence that cancer may be due to modern DNA that supresses ancient DNA that for cell survival when our P53 mechanism does not signal DNA repair or apoptosis ( cell suicide because of substantial DNA damage ).  Also, that a healthy immune system often supresses the aberant cells as well as the fact that metastis of cancer cells happens early.
