# Simple Spark Tutorial
I used the Techsmith Camtasia video editor to edit this simple Spark tutorial.  I enlarged the font size and highlighted the important areas of code.  I learned to just pause when I was uncertian what to say or made a mistake.  This makes it easier to edit the audio.  I used the freely available Audacity application to do audio edits.  Transcoding for youtube and maintaining quality can be difficult until you learn about the preferred formats and settings.
