The evolution of the rate of obesity and diabetes in alarming.  What we eat and when we eat is responsible for so many chronic conditions.  The lack of accesibility of primary health care as well as poor advice on nutrition and an increased consumption of processed foods at frequent invervals has severly impacted our health and budgets. I highly recommend listening to the audio book or reading two books written by Dr. Jason Fung.  You might start with The Cancer Code first. What is very interesting is the evidence that cancer may be due to modern DNA that supresses ancient DNA that for cell survival when our P53 mechanism does not signal DNA repair or apoptosis ( cell suicide because of substantial DNA damage ).  Also, that a healthy immune system often supresses the aberant cells as well as the fact that metastis of cancer cells happens early."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Review of the Cancer Code\n"},{type:b,tag:f,props:{href:i,rel:[j,k,l],target:m},children:[{type:a,value:i}]}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Review of the Obesity Code\n"},{type:b,tag:f,props:{href:n,rel:[j,k,l],target:m},children:[{type:a,value:n}]}]}]},dir:"\u002Fposts",path:"\u002Fposts\u002Fcdc_diabetes",extension:".md",createdAt:"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",updatedAt:"2021-09-05T19:50:51.071Z"},prev:{slug:"topics",title:"Social Media Topics",img:"topics\u002Fcanada_humans_of_new_york_topic_demographics.png",img_alt:"Humans of New York by Province"},next:{slug:"fars",title:"NHTSA FARS",img:"fars\u002Fhouston_l11_fars_density_01to15.png",img_alt:"Density plot of fatal accidents in the Houston metropolitan area for years 2001 through 2015"}}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}("text","element","\n","p","cdc_diabetes","a","cdc_diabetes\u002F2013_percentage_DM2_dx_by_county.png","img","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.goodreads.com\u002Fbook\u002Fshow\u002F52163526-the-cancer-code","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","_blank","https:\u002F\u002Fjilliansnutritionnook.com\u002Freview-of-dr-fungs-obesity-code\u002F")));
